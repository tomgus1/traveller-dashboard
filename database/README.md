# Database Setup - Traveller Dashboard

This directory contains the clean, minimal database setup for the Traveller Dashboard application.

## What's Here

**`setup.sql`** - The ONLY file you need! Contains complete database schema and policies.

**`README.md`** - This documentation file.

## Database Tables

The application uses 4 core tables plus character data tables:

### Core Tables

1. **`user_profiles`** - Additional user information beyond Supabase auth
   - Links to Supabase auth users
   - Stores display names and email

2. **`campaigns`** - Campaign management and metadata
   - Campaign name and description
   - Created by user reference
   - Timestamps for tracking

3. **`campaign_members`** - User roles and membership in campaigns
   - Links users to campaigns with roles (admin, gm, player)
   - Unique constraint to prevent duplicate memberships

4. **`characters`** - Player characters within campaigns
   - Character names (both player name and character name)
   - Linked to campaigns and owned by users
   - Campaign-specific character management

### Character Data Tables

5. **`character_finance`** - Financial transactions per character per campaign
6. **`character_inventory`** - Inventory items per character per campaign
7. **`character_weapons`** - Weapons per character per campaign
8. **`character_armour`** - Armour per character per campaign
9. **`character_ammo`** - Ammunition per character per campaign

## Role System

### üé≠ Role Hierarchy

- **ADMIN**: Can view and edit everything across all campaigns
- **GM (Game Master/Referee)**: Can view all details and manage everything within their assigned campaigns
- **PLAYER**: Can only edit their own characters, view campaign info they're members of

### üîê Security Implementation

- **Character Management**: Players can only edit their own characters; GMs can manage all characters in their campaigns; Admins have full access
- **Campaign Access**: Players can view campaigns they're members of; GMs can fully manage their assigned campaigns; Admins have access to all campaigns
- **Data Isolation**: Character data is campaign-specific and properly secured through Row Level Security policies

## Setup Instructions

### For New Supabase Project

1. Copy the contents of `setup.sql`
2. Paste into your Supabase SQL Editor
3. Run the query
4. Done! ‚úÖ

### Row Level Security

The setup includes comprehensive RLS policies that:

- Allow users to view their own profiles and update them
- Allow campaign members to view campaigns they belong to
- Allow campaign creators to manage their campaigns
- Allow proper role-based access to membership management

## Why This Approach?

‚úÖ **Single File Setup** - Everything in one place  
‚úÖ **Clean and Simple** - Only what the app actually uses  
‚úÖ **No Legacy Code** - Removed all unused tables and complex migrations  
‚úÖ **Proven Working** - Based on actual application usage analysis  
‚úÖ **Future Ready** - Easy to expand when new features are added

## Application Architecture

This database supports the clean architecture pattern used in the application:

- **Core Layer** - Business logic for campaigns and user management
- **Infrastructure Layer** - Supabase implementation
- **Presentation Layer** - React components and hooks

The database schema perfectly matches what the application actually needs, nothing more, nothing less.
